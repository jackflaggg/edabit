// In the Code tab you will find code that is missing a single character in order to pass the tests. However, your goal is to submit a function as minimalist as possible. Use the tips in the tips section below.
//
//     Write a function that returns the strings:
//
//     "both" if both given booleans a and b are true.
// "first" if only a is true.
// "second" if only b is true .
// "neither" if both a and b are false.
//     Tips
// If-else statements can be written as a oneliner using Javascript's ternary operator.
//
// For example, the code:
//
//     function startswith(name) {
//         if ("AEIOU".includes(name[0])) {
//             return "vowel"
//         } else {
//             return "consonant"
//         }
//     }
// Can be simplified to:
//
//     function startswith(name) {
//         return "AEIOU".includes(name[0]) ? "vowel" : "consonant"
//     }
// Bonus
// You can concatenate as many ternary operators as you want. However, concatenating too many can diminish the readability of your code.
//
//     x > 50 ? "majority" : x < 50 ? "minority" : "draw"

function areTrue(a, b) {
    return a && b ? 'both' : !a && b ? 'second' : !b && a ? 'first' : 'neither'
}

console.log(areTrue(false, false))
